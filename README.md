Castle Simulator
In this RTS strategy demo, players command units that can level up and enhance their stats through experience gained in battles. As units engage in combat, they earn experience points, allowing players to upgrade their core attributes like attack power, defense, speed, and special abilities. This progression system adds a dynamic layer to gameplay, rewarding strategic decisions and long-term planning. Players must carefully manage their units' development, tailoring upgrades to suit their tactics and adapt to the evolving battlefield. The result is a deeper, more personalized experience in traditional real-time strategy combat.
